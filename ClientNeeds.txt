- Two POCOS: 
- Developer
    ID Typeof(int)
    Developers have Name Typeof(string) 
    We also need to know wether or not they have access to the online learning tool: Pluralsight (t/f) Typeof(bool)

- DevTeam
    Team ID Typeof(int)
    Team members (Developers) List<T> -> List<Developer>
    Team Name Typeof(string)

- Two Repositories: DeveloperRepo, DevTeamRepo //Collections -> and we can preform actions on those Collections
    Repos need CRUD methods as appropriate

- User Interface (Console Application)


Clients will typically not give you all the info you need, so you may need to use your brain and peers to fill in the blanks!



Teams need to contain their  and their 

Our managers need to be able to add and remove members to/from a team by their unique identifier. They should be able to see a list of existing developers to choose from and add to existing teams. Odds are, the manager will create a team, and then add Developers individually from the Developer Directory to that team.

Challenge: Our HR Department uses the software monthly to get a list of all our Developers that need a Pluralsight license. Create this functionality in the Console Application

Challenge: Some of our managers are nitpicky and would like the functionality to add multiple Developers to a team at once, rather than one by one. Integrate this into your application.
